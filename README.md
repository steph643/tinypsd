**Tinypsd compresses your psd files by up to 95%, allowing for cheaper and faster backup.**

### Demo

### How it works

To compress a psd file, tinypsd can use one or more of the following lossless technics:
1. removal of the cached data of the linked and embedded smart objects
2. cancellation of the *Maximize Compatibility* option

The resulting psd file is usually much smaller than the original, ***but*** it requires a few simple steps, in Photoshop, to be restored to its original state (see the  demo).

### What now?

I developped this prototype for my own use, because backing up my design work was starting to be a nightmare. I'm now wondering if it deserves to be developped further. **If you'd like to see this project move forward, please fill [this short survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJUtbC4O7cmTQv2qjXZBuEoTOqfjzADHgMOqzgrqqjuWNCdg/viewform?usp=sf_link)** and advertise tinypsd to your friends and colleagues.
