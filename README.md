**tinypsd compresses your psd files down to 5% of their orginal size. This allows for cheaper and faster backups.**

## Demo


## How it works

tinypsd:
* removes cached data of smart objects (both linked and embedded),
* cancels the *Maximize Compatibility* option.

The resulting psd file is usually much smaller, *but* it requires a few simple steps, in Photoshop, to be restored to its original state (see the above demo).

## What now?

I developped this prototype for my own use, because I was sick of the size of my backups. I am now trying to figure out if it is worth investing more time. If you are interested, please fill this short survey.
