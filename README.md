**tinypsd compresses your psd files down to 5% of their orginal size. This allows for cheaper and faster backups.**

### Demo

*Video under way*

### How it works

To achieve size reduction of a psd file, tinypsd:
* removes cached data of smart objects (both linked and embedded)
* cancels its *Maximize Compatibility* option

The resulting psd file is usually way smaller than the original, ***but*** it requires a few simple steps, in Photoshop, to be restored to its original state.

### What now?

I developped this prototype for my own use, because I was sick of the size of my backups. I'm now wondering if it deserves to be developped further. If you'd like to see this project move forward, please fill this short survey.
