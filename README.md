**tinypsd compresses your psd files down to 5% of their orginal size. This allows for cheaper and faster backups.**

### Demo


### How it works

To achieve size reduction of a psd file, tinypsd:
* removes cached data of smart objects - both linked and embedded -, and
* cancels the *Maximize Compatibility* option.

The resulting psd file is usually way smaller than the original, *but* it requires a few simple steps, in Photoshop, to be restored to its original state (see the above demo).

### What now?

I developped this prototype for my own use, because I was sick of the size of my backups. I'm now wondering if it's worth investing more time. If you'd like this project to move forward, please fill this short survey.
