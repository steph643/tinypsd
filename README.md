# How it works

To compress a PSD file, tinypsd uses one or more of the following lossless technics:
1. removal of the cached data of the linked and embedded smart objects
2. cancellation of the *Maximize Compatibility* option

The resulting PSD file is usually much smaller than the original, ***but*** it requires a few simple steps, in Photoshop, to be restored to its original state (see the  demo).

# What now?

I developped this prototype for my own use, because backing up my work was becoming a nightmare. I am now wondering if it deserves to be scaled up.
