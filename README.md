#### tinypsd compresses your psd files by up to 95, allowing for cheaper and faster backups.

### Demo

*Video under way*

### How it works

To achieve size reduction of a psd file, tinypsd:
1. removes cached data of smart objects (both linked and embedded)
2. cancels its *Maximize Compatibility* option

The resulting psd file is usually much smaller than the original, ***but*** it requires a few simple steps, in Photoshop, to be restored to its original state (see the above demo).

### What now?

I developped this prototype for my own use, because I was sick of the size of my backups. I'm now wondering if it deserves to be developped further.
