# How it works

To compress a PSD file, tinypsd uses one or more of the following lossless technics:
1. it removes the cached data of the linked and embedded smart objects,
2. it cancels the *Maximize Compatibility* option.

The compressed file is usually much smaller than the original one, yet it contains the full original data. A few simple steps are required, in Photoshop, to restore the file to its otiginal state (see the above demo).

# What now?

I developped this prototype for my own use, because backing up my work was becoming a nightmare. I am now wondering if it deserves to be scaled up. **If you'd like to see this project move forward, please fill [this short survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJUtbC4O7cmTQv2qjXZBuEoTOqfjzADHgMOqzgrqqjuWNCdg/viewform?usp=sf_link)**.
